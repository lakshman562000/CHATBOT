# CHATBOT
# Project Overview

This repository presents a cutting-edge conversational AI project, harnessing the power of OpenAI's language model to create an engaging and interactive chatbot. The chatbot is designed to converse with users in real-time, providing natural language-based responses that simulate human-like conversations.

# Project Structure

The repository consists of four primary components:

1. [Simple Chatbot](https://github.com/lakshman562000/CHATBOT/blob/main/Simple%20Chatbot.py) A Python script demonstrating a basic chatbot utilizing OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model. It engages users via text input and generates AI-driven responses.
2. [Interactive Chatbot](https://github.com/lakshman562000/CHATBOT/blob/main/Interactive%20chatbot%20using%20OpenAI%20API.py) A Python code creating a dynamic chatbot using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model. It takes user input, stores chat messages, and prompts users to specify the chatbot type.
3. [Chatbot Web Interface](https://github.com/lakshman562000/CHATBOT/blob/main/Chatbot%20as%20Interface%20in%20Web.py) A Python script implementing a chatbot using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model, hosted on a web interface. It requires OpenAI and Gradio libraries, and users can interact with the chatbot by inputting text messages.
4. [AI Voice Assistant](https://github.com/lakshman562000/CHATBOT/blob/main/AI%20Assistant.py) A virtual assistant powered by artificial intelligence, offering voice and text interfaces for various functions, including opening applications, providing real-time information, and sending messages.
